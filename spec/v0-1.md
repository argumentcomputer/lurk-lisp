# Lurk Language Specification

Lurk is a statically scoped dialect of Lisp, influenced by Scheme and Common Lisp.

## Acks

Some parts of this specification repeat R5RS.

## Notes

An error is raised when a program does not satisfy a _"must"_ or _"should"_ clause. We use "_must_" clauses for syntactic requirements and _"should"_ for semantic requirements.

## Built-Ins

### No Shadowing

Built-in forms are all special, in that they cannot be shadowed: built-in values cannot be shadowed in any context, and syntactic forms `(<operator> <operand> ...)` cannot be shadowed in procedural context. For example, re-defining `car` will not change the behavior of `(car '(1 2))`, but the re-defined `car` will be visible in `(((lambda (x) x) car) '(1 2))`.

### `t`, `nil`

Like in Common Lisp, the expressions `t` and `nil` are self-evaluating and denote true and false respectively.

### `if`

The expression `(if <test> <consequent> <alternate>)` is evaluated by first evaluating `<test>` and then evaluating the `<consequent>` or the `<alternative>` depending on whether the `<test>` value is non-`nil` (true) or `nil`.

Unlike in Scheme and Common Lisp, the `<alternate>` expression cannot be omitted.

### `lambda`

The expression `(lambda <formals> <body>)` evaluates to a procedure.

The environment in effect when the `lambda` expression was evaluated is remembered as part of the procedure (a closure). When the procedure is later called with some actual arguments, the environment in which the `lambda` expression was evaluated will be extended by binding the variables in the formal argument list to the corresponding actual argument values, and the expression in the body of the `lambda` expression will be evaluated in the extended environment. The result of the expression in the body will be returned as the result of the procedure call.

The `<formals>` must be a list of variable names, `(<variable1> ...)`, denoting a fixed number of arguments.
The `<body>` term must be exactly one expression (unlike Scheme).

In a procedure call `(<operator> <operand> ...)`, assuming `<operator>` is not a built-in form, the `<operator>` should evaluate to a procedure (a closure), and the remaining arguments `<operand> ...` are evaluated from left to right.

Auto-currying: `lambda` expressions taking multiple parameters are automatically transformed into nested `lambda` expressions of one parameter each. Correspondingly, application of multiple arguments are automatically transformed into nested applications of one argument each. Auto-currying naturally supports partial applications. Hence a procedure does not need to be called with exactly the same number of arguments as the number of formals.


### `let`

In the expression `(let <bindings> <body>)`, `<bindings>` must have the form `((<variable1> <init1>) ...)` and body must be exactly one expression (unlike Scheme).

In a `let` expression, the bindings are performed sequentially from left to right, like Scheme's `let*` and unlike Scheme's `let`, which establishes bindings in paralell.

The region of a binding indicated by `(<variable> <init>)` is that part of the `let` expression to the right of the binding. Thus the second binding is done in an environment in which the first is visible, and so on.

### `letrec`

The `letrec` expression has the same form as the `let` expression: `(letrec <bindings> <body>)`.

In a `letrec` expression, the bindings are performed sequentially from left to right.

The region of a binding indicated by `(<variable> <init>)` is that part of the `let` expression to the right of the binding _but including itself_. Thus the second binding is done in an environment in which the first and second are visible, and so on.

Note: Lurk's `letrec` is unlike Scheme's `letrec` in that only self (not mutual) recursion is allowed. It is similar in evaluation order to Scheme's `letrec*`, but not in the regions.

### `quote`

The expression `(quote <datum>)` or `'<datum>` evaluates to `<datum>`.

### `atom`

The expression `(atom <e>)` evaluates to `t` if `<e>` evaluates to an atom (non-list) and to `nil` if `<e>` evaluates to a non-atom (list).

### `procedure`

The expression `(procedure <e>)` evaluates to `t` if `<e>` evaluates to a procedure (a closure, the result of a `lambda`) and to `nil` if `<e>` evaluates to a non-procedure.

### `cons`, `car`, `cdr`

The expression `(cons <a> <d>)` produces a pair whose `car` is `<a>` and whose `cdr` is `<d>`. The expression `(car <e>)` and `(cdr <e>)` return the `car` and `cdr` of the pair resulting from the evaluation of `<e>`.
It is an error to call `car` or `cdr` on an argument value that is not a pair.

Consing is implemented by hash-consing.

### `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`

Let `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` be noted as `<op>`. The expression `(<op> <e1> <e2>)` evaluates by first evaluating `<e1>` and `<e2>` in order. The resulting values should be numbers. Then, the operation `op` is performed on these two numbers.

Arithmetic operations are defined over a prime field, where the order is a parameter of the language.
If the order is `P`, one can find `P - 1` by evaluating `(- 0 1)`.

### `=`, `eq`

The expression `(= <e1> <e2>)` evaluates by first evaluating the expressions `<e1>` and `<e2>`. The resulting values should be numbers. Then, the numers are compared for equality (over the prime field).

The expression  `(eq <e1> <e2>)` evaluates by first evaluating the expressions `<e1>` and `<e2>` and then comparing the resulting values. For pairs, pointer equality is used.

### `emit`

The expression `(emit <e>)` evaluates the expression `<e>` and "emits" as well as returns the resulting value.
Emitting is an implementation-specific operation that makes the value visible to the outside world.

### `begin`

The expression `(begin <e> ...)` evaluates each expression `<e>` in order and returns the result of evaluating the last expression.

### `current-env`

The expression `(current-env)` evaluates to the current environment represented as an association list.

An environment is represented as list where each item is either a binding or an environment. An item is an environment when the extension is recursive.

### `eval`

The expression `(eval <exp>)` or `(eval <exp> <env>)` first evaluates the expression `<exp>`, and then evaluates the resulting value treated as an expression in the environment obtained from the evaluation of `<env>`. If the argument `<env>` is omitted, the empty environment is used.

While `eval` is part of core Lurk, it is not part of the initial `lurk-rs` release.
